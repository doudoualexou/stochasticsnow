**Stochastic Modelling of Snow Depth in Mountains, by Alexandre Faroux**

This research paper was written with the goal of applying stochastics (Wiener process) to the modelling of snow depth in mountains. Throughout the paper, I explore possible applications, try to find an accurate model and build a Python program capable of running simmulations, to prove its accuracy and make predictions.
